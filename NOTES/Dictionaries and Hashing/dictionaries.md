# Dictionaries

A dictionary is a data repository designed to effectively perform the search operation. The user assigns keys to data elements and uses them to perform search, insert and remove operations. We store key-element pairs {% math %} (k, e) {% endmath %} called **items** into a dictionary.

## Unordered Dictionaries
In the most general case, we can allow multiple elements to have the same key - however this is not advantageous in some applications, for example, multiple users with the said ID would be confusing.

In the cases when keys are unique, a key associated to an object can be regarded as an address of this object. Such dictionaries are referred to as **associative stores**.

### Abstract Data Type
As an abstract data type, a dictionary supports the following methods.

| Method Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `findElement(k)` | return an element {% math %} e {% endmath %} with key {% math %} k {% endmath %} if it exists, else `NO_SUCH_KEY` |
| `insertItem(k, e)` | insert an item with element {% math %} e {% endmath %} with key {% math %} k {% endmath %}|
| `removeElement(k)` | removes an element with key {% math %} k {% endmath %} and return its element if it exists, else `NO_SUCH_KEY` |

### Log Files
One simple way of representing an unordered dictionary is by an unsorted sequence {% math %} S {% endmath %}, implemented itself by a vector or list that stores the keys and its corresponding elements. Such implementation is referred to as a **log file** or **audit trial**. This implementation is suitable for storing a small amount of data that does not change much over time.

Ordered Dictionaries
In a ordered dictionary, we use a comparator to provide the order relation among the keys. Such ordering allows efficient implementation of the dictionary abstract data type.

###Â Abstract Data Type
An **ordered dictionary** also supports the following methods:

| Method Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `closestKeyBefore(k)` | returns the largest key that is {% math %} \leq k {% endmath %} |
| `closestElemBefore(k)` | returns {% math %} e {% endmath %} with the largest key that is {% math %} \leq k {% endmath %} |
| `closestKeyAfter(k)` | returns the smallest key that is {% math %} \geq k {% endmath %} |
| `closesElemAfter(k)` | returns {% math %} e {% endmath %} with the smallest key that is {% math %} \geq k {% endmath %} |

### Sorted Table
If a dictionary {% math %} D {% endmath %} is ordered, the items can be stored in a vector {% math %} S {% endmath %} by non-decreasing order of the keys. The ordering of the keys allow faster searching than in the case of unordered sequences, which are possibly implemented as a linked list.

The ordered vector implementation of a dictionary {% math %} D {% endmath %} is referred to as the **lookup table**. The implementation of `insertItem(k, e)` in a lookup table takes {% math %} O(n) {% endmath %} time in the worse case, as we need to shift up all the items with keys greater than {% math %} k {% endmath %} to make room for the new item.
