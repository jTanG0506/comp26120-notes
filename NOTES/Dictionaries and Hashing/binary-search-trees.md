# Binary Search Trees

##Â Binary Search
If {% math %} S {% endmath %} is an ordered sequence of {% math %} n {% endmath %} elements, then the element at rank (position) {% math %} i {% endmath %} has a key that is not smaller than the keys of the items at ranks {% math %} 0, \cdots, i - 1 {% endmath %} and no larger than the keys of items at ranks {% math %} i + 1, \cdots, n - 1 {% endmath %}. This ordering allows quick searching of the sequence {% math %} S {% endmath %}. The algorithm has two parameters **high** and **low**. All candidates for a sought element at a current stage of the search are bracketed between these two parameters.

```
Algorithm BinarySearch(S, k, low, high)
  Input: An ordered vector S storing n items, a search key k and the (low, high) integer pair
  Output: An element of S with the key k, otherwise an exception

  if low > high then
    return NO_SUCH_KEY
  else
    mid = int((low + high) / 2)
    if k = key(mid) then
      return e(mid)
    elseif k < key(mid) then
      BinarySearch(S, k, low, mid - 1)
    else
      BinarySearch(S, k, mid + 1, high)
    end
  end
```

#### Computational Cost
First, notice that at each call of the algorithm there is a constant number of operations, thus the running time is proportional to the number of recursive calls. At each recursive call, the number of candidates that need to be considered is {% math %} high - low + 1 {% endmath %}, which is reduced by at least half at each recursive call. If {% math %} T(n) {% endmath %} is the computational cost of a binary search, then:
{% math %}
T(n) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            c & \quad \text{if} \, n < 2 \\
            T(n / 2) + c & \quad \text{otherwise}
        \end{array}
    \right.
{% endmath %}
In the worse case, the stop terminates when there are no more candidate items, so the maximal number of recursive calls is {% math %} m {% endmath %} such that {% math %} n / 2^m < 1 {% endmath %}, which implies that {% math %} \lfloor \log n \rfloor + 1 {% endmath %}, so `BinarySearch(S, k, 0, n - 1)` runs in {% math %} O(\log n) {% endmath %} time.

## Binary Search Tree
A **binary search tree** is a tree data structure adapted to a binary search algorithm. Each node stores an element {% math %} e {% endmath %} and that the elements in the left subtree of such node are smaller or equal to {% math %} e {% endmath %}, while the elements in the right subtree of such node are greater or equal to {% math %} e {% endmath %}. An inorder traversal of a binary search tree visits the elements in the non-decreasing order.

A binary search tree can be used to search for an element by traversing down the tree. At each node, we compare the value we are searching for, {% math %} x {% endmath %}, with {% math %} e {% endmath %}, with three outcomes:
- if {% math %} x = e {% endmath %}, the search terminates successfully

- if {% math %} x < e {% endmath %}, the search continues in the left subtree

- if {% math %} x > e {% endmath %}, the search continues in the right subtree

If the whole subtree is visited and the element is not found, the search terminates unsuccessfully.

#### Computational Cost
The binary tree search algorithm executes a constant number of operations for each node during the traversal. The binary search algorithm starts from the root node and goes down one level at each call and the number of levels in a binary search tree is called the height {% math %} h {% endmath %}. It follows that `findElement` runs in {% math %} O(h) {% endmath %} - which can be a problem as {% math %} h {% endmath %} can potentially be close to {% math %} n {% endmath %}. To deal with this issue, we need to keep the tree height optimal, as close as {% math %} O(\log n) {% endmath %} as possible, one way to do this is to use an [AVL tree](avl-trees.md).
