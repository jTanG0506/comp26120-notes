# Tractable vs Intractable Problems

An algorithm is said to be **polynomial-time** if its worse case time complexity is amongst {% math %}O(1), O(N), O(N^2), O(N^3), ...{% endmath %}. We consider these as *fast algorithms* and as **tractable solutions** to a problem.

Algorithms that behave in the worst-case as {% math %}2^N, N^N{% endmath %} or {% math %}N!{% endmath %} are very slow and are considered as **intractable algorithms** in general.
